# ELO Rust Target: Implementation Phases

**Project**: ELO Rust Code Generation Backend
**Duration**: ~13 weeks (5 phases)
**Status**: Phase 2 - Complete, Ready for Phase 3
**Methodology**: Phased TDD with Ruthless Quality Control

---

## Quick Overview

This directory contains the detailed implementation plan for building a production-grade Rust code generation target for the ELO validation language. Each phase is organized as a series of TDD cycles, following the pattern:

**RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → CLEANUP**

---

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Setup & Architecture (Weeks 1-2)
**Status**: ✅ [x] Complete

- [x] Create Cargo project structure
- [x] Initialize module hierarchy
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Design type mapping system
- [x] Create testing framework

**Outcome**: Solid foundation with project skeleton, tests passing, zero Clippy warnings

---

### Phase 2: Core Code Generator (Weeks 3-6)
**Status**: ✅ [x] Complete

- [x] Implement AST visitor pattern
- [x] Handle literal values (strings, numbers, dates)
- [x] Implement binary operators (comparisons, logical)
- [x] Implement unary operators (!, -)
- [x] Handle field access (user.age)
- [x] Implement short-circuit evaluation

**Outcome**: Basic expressions compile to Rust code with full test coverage (166 tests)

---

### Phase 3: Standard Library Functions (Weeks 7-9)
**Status**: ⏳ [ ] Not Started

- [ ] String functions (matches, contains, length, etc.)
- [ ] Date/time functions (today, now, age, etc.)
- [ ] Array functions (contains, any, all, etc.)
- [ ] Type checking functions (is_null, is_empty, etc.)
- [ ] Error message handling

**Outcome**: All stdlib functions working, end-to-end validation examples pass

---

### Phase 4: Integration & Ergonomics (Weeks 10-12)
**Status**: ⏳ [ ] Not Started

- [ ] Implement `#[elo_validator]` derive macro
- [ ] Add CLI integration
- [ ] Create example projects (Actix, Axum, Tokio)
- [ ] Build comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

**Outcome**: Production-ready, with ergonomic APIs and excellent DX

---

### Phase 5: Finalization (Week 13)
**Status**: ⏳ [ ] Not Started

- [ ] Quality control review (architecture, error handling, edge cases)
- [ ] Security audit (input validation, secrets, dependencies)
- [ ] Remove all development markers (Phase comments, TODOs)
- [ ] Polish documentation
- [ ] Final verification (all tests, all lints, clean build)

**Outcome**: Production-ready code ready for upstream merge

---

## Guidelines for Each Phase

### Before Starting a Phase
1. Read the phase document completely
2. Understand all success criteria
3. Review dependencies (what must be done first)
4. Verify blocking issues are resolved

### During a Phase
1. Follow **TDD discipline strictly**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → CLEANUP
2. Write test first, verify it fails
3. Write minimal code to pass (no over-engineering)
4. Refactor to improve design
5. Run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
6. Commit with clear message: `type(scope): description [Phase N, Cycle M: CLEANUP]`

### Ending a Phase
1. All tests pass
2. Zero Clippy warnings
3. All success criteria checked
4. Ready for next phase dependencies

## Current Progress

| Phase | Status | Cycles | Cycles Complete |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1: Setup | ✅ Complete | 4 | 4/4 |
| 2: CodeGen | ✅ Complete | 4 | 4/4 |
| 3: Stdlib | ⏳ Ready | 3 | 0/3 |
| 4: Macros | ⏳ Blocked | 3 | 0/3 |
| 5: Finalize | ⏳ Blocked | 1 | 0/1 |

**Total Progress**: 8/15 cycles complete (53.3%)

---

## Key Milestones

- ✅ **Week 1-2**: Project structure created + CI/CD ready (COMPLETE)
- ✅ **Type System**: Design finalized and implemented (COMPLETE)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive infrastructure built (COMPLETE)
- ✅ **Week 6**: Basic expressions compile to Rust (COMPLETE - 166 tests)
- ⏳ **Week 9**: All stdlib functions working (Phase 3)
- ⏳ **Week 12**: Derive macros and examples complete (Phase 4)
- ⏳ **Week 13**: Ready for upstream merge (Phase 5)

## How to Use This Directory

1. **Start a new phase**: Read `phase-0N-*.md`
2. **Work a cycle**: Follow the TDD pattern (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → CLEANUP)
3. **Commit progress**: Include `[Phase N, Cycle M: CLEANUP]` in commit
4. **Mark complete**: Update checkboxes in this README and phase file
5. **Move to next**: Check dependencies before proceeding

---

## Quality Gates

### During Development
- ✅ Tests written first (RED → GREEN)
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Zero Clippy warnings (`-D warnings`)
- ✅ Code formatted with `cargo fmt`
- ✅ Minimal, focused changes per cycle

### Before Phase Completion
- ✅ All success criteria checked
- ✅ No commented-out code
- ✅ No debug prints/logs
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Dependencies resolved

### Before Shipping (Phase 5)
- ✅ No `// Phase X:` comments in code
- ✅ No `# TODO: Phase` markers
- ✅ No `FIXME` without fixes
- ✅ No commented experiments
- ✅ `git grep -i "phase\|todo\|fixme"` returns nothing

## Dependencies Between Phases

```
Phase 1: Setup
    ↓ (provides: project structure, test framework, type system)
Phase 2: CodeGen
    ↓ (provides: working code generator)
Phase 3: Stdlib
    ↓ (provides: standard library support)
Phase 4: Macros
    ↓ (provides: ergonomic APIs)
Phase 5: Finalize
    (produces: production-ready code)
```

## Important Notes

- **TDD is non-negotiable**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → CLEANUP always
- **Tests first**: Write test before implementation
- **Minimal GREEN**: No over-engineering, make tests pass with minimal code
- **Zero Clippy warnings**: Run before every commit
- **Clean commits**: One concern per commit, clear messages
